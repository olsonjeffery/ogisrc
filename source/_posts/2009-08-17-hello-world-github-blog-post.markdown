Wow, five days short of a whole year since my last post on my blogger.com blog. I've kind of had the idea in my head for some time to move my blog to GitHub. I may lose some bells and whistles, but I gain an easier way (in my opinion) to create and publish posts (and plus, markdown > *).

Anywho, hopefully I'll post more, since I don't have any shortage of ideas kicking around that I'd like to share.

And now, some code to see how highlighting looks:

    import System
    import System.Collections.Generic

    public class Foo(Bar):
      public def constructor():
        pass

      public def Baz(input as string) as string:
        return 'Foobie '+input

Here's to many more!
